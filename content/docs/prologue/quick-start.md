## HR Business Cycle Appification

[HR Information System Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hJH26SHTOk&list=PLDiTLW7eMZTRVaJ8cyPpka5gvNSCePimQ) is what we created in a month for one of the most famous fast-food chains in the World (for their Georgian representation).

## CovidBeds

Doks uses npm to centralize dependency management, making it [easy to update]({{< relref "how-to-update" >}}) resources, build tooling, plugins, and build scripts:

- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (it includes npm) for your platform.

## Start a new Doks project

Create a new site, change directories, install dependencies, and start development server.

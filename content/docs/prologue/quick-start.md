## CovidBeds - Vacant beds information system for covid patients

Implemented online process of Covid-19 patient hospitalization/discharge in 120 medical centers. Central administration of Ministry of Health of Georgia recieves information on vacant beds, which facilitates the process of immediate response on Covid patient transfer all around Georgia.

## Rural Doctors LMS

In collaboration with UNICEF and USAID Georgia we created a [Learning Management System](https://www.facebook.com/unicefgeorgia/videos/453192065941423) for 1300 rural doctors. The main goal of the centralized platform was to help rural populations, including mothers and children, to receive necessary support from well-trained rural primary healthcare professionals.

_"The trainings give us a lot of experience, new information is provided to us literally up to the minute. These trainings are conducted by prominent doctors. These online meetings bring together rural doctors from all over the district and we exchange information with each other, who needs what, who can provide support."_  - Amiran Mushkudiani, Geguti village doctor
